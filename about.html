                        <h1>About Helen Post</h1>

								<p><strong>Helen N. Post</strong> has worked in a variety of mediums and finds a different way to express herself in each medium.  At this time in her career as an artist, she finds herself working with pastels and oils most satisfying.</p>

								<p>Helen Post is particularly drawn to both color and form in landscapes, and in still lifes.  Her landscapes are painted on location, while her still lifes are carefully composed in her studio.  As a colorist, Ms. Post tries to express the joy that colors stir in her.  The result is a vibrant interpretation that can be seen in her paintings.</p>

								<p>Each painting, whether it is in oil or another medium, contains the elements of good design that includes proper composition, balance of color and shape, and the appropriate use of values.</p>

								<p>Her mixed media collages consist of a variety of materials:   different colored papers, including wallpaper, printed matter from magazines, cut up or torn pastels, watercolors, and marbled papers are included.  Broken pieces of stained glass and jewelry are also used and the combination of colors and shapes are worked into a design that is as much a puzzle as a piece of art. </p>

								<p>Helen Post graduated from Pratt Institute, majoring in illustration.  She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Art Therapy from Trenton State University, and shortly afterwards received a Masters in Education degree from Rutgers, the State University, specializing in the creative arts.</p>

								<p>Helen Post has received numerous awards for her work, including an Award for Excellence in oil painting from the juror and artist, Jacob Landau.  In addition, she was given an award from the Pastel Society of America, and one of her paintings was chosen to tour Russia.</p>

								<p>Her paintings can be viewed in the corporate offices of Bristol Meyer Squibb, Johnson and Johnson, and in many private collections.</p>

								<p>She has taught painting at Mercer County College and the Senior Center of East Brunswick, New Jersey and South Brunswick, New Jersey.  Ms. Post was the Educator and Artist in Residence for two years at Cornelius Low House, the Middlesex County Museum, as well as being the curator for the Bicentennial for the Weatherill House Museum in South Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>
